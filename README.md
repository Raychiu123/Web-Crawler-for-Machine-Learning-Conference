# Web-Crawler-of-Top-Conferences-for-Machine-Learning

Fetch some keywords and save the title of paper into excel from ICRL and NeurIPS.

- NeurIPS doesn't use javascript in their website(easier to scrape).
- ICLR uses javasript to generate the post content, so we need to use webdriver to help us get dynamically pages.
- Just need to change the 'keywords' in code, and will get the information you want.
